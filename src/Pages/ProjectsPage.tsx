                                less-used cells are culled and any glyphs contained within must be reloaded to be used again.

                                Many actions require the correct thread context to be completed such as loading new textures, creating 3D objects, and enqueuing a new audio file.
                                This is handled by a series of Dispatch methods within each thread that enqueue the required actions and handle them in periods that are 
                                convenient for the handling thread. Ex, the Game Logic thread would dispatch an action to the Render thread to load the 3D model of a newly spawned tree. 
                                The Render thread would then load that tree into memory at the end of its current render cycle

                            <li>

                Windows Kernel Driver
            </h1>
            <div style={{...textStyle, marginTop: 25}}>
                A kernel driver developed using Windows Driver Kit. 
                This driver intercepts keyboard packets before the hardware information identifying the keyboard is stripped away by the operating system.
                By utilizing this identifying keyboard hardware information,
                the user can have 2 keyboards plugged into their system simultaneously and register one of them within the client application to pair it with the driver.
                The driver will then send all keypress information from the registered keyboard to the client application for handling while nonregistered
                keyboard keypresses will be passed on to Windows normally
                <br/><br/>
                A kernel driver must be used for this because the hardware information is stripped out of the keyboard packet before it is able to be handled by 
                drivers in user space

                    <li>
                        The driver registers a keyboard when the buttons right ctrl, page up, page down are pressed at the same time on the selected keyboard. 
                        Keyboards must be unregistered via the client. If the keyboard the user is attempting to register is the only keyboard connected 
                        to the system, the registration will fail
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Buffers keydown events for the registered keyboard until all keydown events have a corresponding keyup. When this occurs, the 
                        macro is complete and the key information is sent to the client via a file connection that the client establishes. (ie if a user
                        pressed a+s+d at the same time, when they let go of the keys the driver would send that a, s, d packet to the client)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Some arbitrary key combinations are impossible and return a keyboard error code due to (I assume) the internal wiring of the keyboard. Examples include: most combinations of keys
                        greater than 4 characters long and some sets of adjacent characters such as f+g+h

                    <li>
                        The project is split into 3 main sections: The main popup menu, the YouTube tab content script, and a script that gets injected into the YouTube tab
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The main popup menu allows the user to control the playback of videos on any open YouTube tab and also allows the user to select new videos from the video playlist 
                        or recommended video list. By default, the extension will autoplay the next video once the current video completes
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The YouTube tab content script manages messages sent from the main popup. When it receives a message it passes it to the injected script since content scripts cannot
                        directly interact with DOM elements
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The injected script does the majority of the heavy lifting in the extension and is what actually controls the embedded YouTube video player. It also collates the 
                        playlist video information, tracks and reports the current video time to the main popup, and selects the next video when the current video ends
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There are also a handful of quality of life features such as disabling YouTube's automatic idle popup and the ability to set end times on videos
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    <li>
                        Allows YouTube links and local files to be imported into playlists and enqueued as tracks into a playback queue. The playback queue is then streamed to the backend
                        and sent to the Discord application using the Discord API

                    <li>
                        Currently the backend server must be hosted on the same machine that the client is running on but that is only the case for this MVP version of the 
                        project. With only a couple minor tweaks the backend could be hosted on an external server with no issues

                        Written in C++ and uses CMake to manage the build process

                    <li>
                        Allows file transfers between any two machines connected on a network. Transfers can be done over the public internet, local subnets, 
                        and even on the same machine
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        All the user has to do to transfer files is to run the application as a source on the transferring machine 
                        (while supplying the names of the files/folders to transfer as well as their name on the destination) 
                        and then run another instance as a destination on the destination machine
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Can transfer nested file structures and arbitrarily large files. If I were to revisit this project further, I would implement file compression to reduce
                        network bandwidth and encryption to protect from potential MITM attacks

                        Accepts socket traffic on port 80 and parses it as HTTP or HTTPS. HTTPS handling isn't fully integrated at this point but it is
                        mostly finished once integration with the crypto++ library is implemented (at some point)

                        Supports static website and file hosting. Only files within the server's designated folder can be accessed by the webserver.

                        the webserver won't attempt to compress a png but will attempt to compress a plaintext file)
