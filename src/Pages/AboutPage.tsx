                    <li>
                        Worked on a team of developers to migrate a suite of 7 legacy applications developed with native windows handling to a modern
                        cross-platform tech stack utilizing .NET Core, React, Typescript, and PostgreSQL
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Optimized the deployment process for versioning, updating, and deploying co-dependent packages in the codebase, decreasing
                        deployment time by 80% (from 70 minutes to 15 minutes)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Decreased system update time by 95% by designing a new automatic update system for machines running locked down operating
                        systems and completely removing the need for a tech to manually update each system individually
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Researched and enacted a debugging approach that rapidly lead to the elimination of 100% of known bugs in a class of hard to
                        track down issues resulting from a complicated, multi-process application initialization routine
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Increased developer efficiency by over 30% on common operations by designing and compiling a suite of 5 DevOps tools to
                        simplify click/command intensive actions in the codebase. These tools achieved widespread adoption by the team and became a
                        requirement for new team members to learn
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Onboarded 3 new team members, introducing the team's tools, practices, and culture
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Designed and implemented a total backend overhaul for a large class of network operations resulting in an increase in efficiency
                        of affected network calls by 50%. Additionally, completed this overhaul well ahead of schedule
                    </li>
